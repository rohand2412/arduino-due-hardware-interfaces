# Arduino Due Hardware Interfaces

This repository is a collection of [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) projects that are mainly test cases/example code for [this arduino library](https://gitlab.com/rohand2412/arduino-due-libraries). The test cases are written to stress test the classes and make use of as many methods from their respective classes as they can. Feel free to use these programs as a precursor to bug test any pull requests for that library.
